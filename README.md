# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning
Overview
Customer churn, the rate at which customers discontinue services with a company, is a critical metric in industries like telecommunications. Understanding and predicting churn can help businesses retain customers and maximize revenue. This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using machine learning techniques.

Objective
Determine the percentage of churned customers and those who remain active.
Analyze various features contributing to customer churn.
Identify the most suitable machine learning model for accurate churn classification.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset, which includes:

Information about customers who left within the last month (Churn).
Services each customer has signed up for (e.g., phone, internet).
Customer account details (e.g., contract type, payment method).
Demographic information (e.g., gender, age range).
Implementation
Libraries used:

scikit-learn: for machine learning modeling.
Matplotlib and seaborn: for data visualization.
pandas and NumPy: for data manipulation and analysis.
Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset's characteristics and relationships.
Feature Engineering: Selecting and creating relevant features for modeling.
Model Selection: Testing various machine learning algorithms to find the most accurate churn prediction model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the chosen model and fine-tuning parameters if necessary.
Conclusion
By accurately predicting customer churn, businesses can implement targeted retention strategies to reduce customer attrition and increase profitability.
